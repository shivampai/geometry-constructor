# Geometry Constructor
Geometry Constructor is an interactive web application designed to help students and educators visualize and manipulate geometric shapes, specifically focusing on the Cartesian plane. Users can input points and line segments to dynamically create, analyze, and explore different geometric figures.

## Hosting Details : 
The Web App is hosted live using [Firebase CLI Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting) on a subdomain.

## Features
- **Interactive Cartesian Plane:** Visualize points and line segments on the Cartesian plane.
- **Dynamic Line Intersection:** Calculate and display the intersection points of lines.
- **Real-time Geometry Construction:** Create geometric shapes by entering points and connecting them with lines.
- **Educational Focus:** Best suited for students learning basic geometry and Cartesian planes.
- **Customizable UI:** Users can adjust point positions and line segments in real time.
- **Responsive Design:** Works across different screen sizes and devices.
- **Circles:** This project allows to construct circles
- **Area/Perimeter Calculation:** Automatically calculate the area and perimeter of triangles/circles.
- **Save/Load Projects:** Allow users to save and load geometry constructions in multiple file options such as [.plane](plane-file-type.md) .
- **Toolbox:** Has numerous tools for enhancing user experience & convenient geometric calculation.
  
## Technologies Used
- **HTML5:** Markup for the page structure.
- **CSS3:** Styling for a responsive and clean design.
- **JavaScript:** Logic to handle geometric calculations and interactions.
- **Canvas API:** For drawing the geometric figures on the Cartesian plane.
