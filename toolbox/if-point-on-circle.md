# Check if a point lies on a circle
## How it works : 
- The user inputs the circle `.circles-as-options` dropdown & the point `.points-as-options` dropdown.
- On button click, a JS function is triggered.
- The JS function finds the radius & center point name of the circle.
- The length of *the point* to *the circle's center point* is calculated using `findLengthOf(lineName)` function.
- If the length from center point to the inputed point is equal to the circle radius, the point lies on the circle, or else it does not lie on the circle.
- The output is displayed on a `div`.
