# Trisect
## How it works:
- User input is taken from a `.lines-as-options` dropdown, the onchange event triggers a JS function.
- The JS function uses *SECTION FORMULA* twice. Once with *m1 = 2, m2 = 1* & the second time with *m1 = 1, m2 = 1*.
- This gives the coordinates of 2 points that trisect the line segment.
- The output is shown on a label alongside a button which adds the points to the canvas when clicked.
